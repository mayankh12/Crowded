# Crowded
Hackviolet Project

## Inspiration
We want to ensure the safety of our society and help maintain social distance. Along with that we see that mental illness is increasing as we are isolated from others. We want to help people be able to go out and take a break, safely in areas that are not crowded.

## What it does
Crowded takes in Google Maps live count of how busy a place is and visually displays it on the map for the user to see. If the data is not available, our algorithm uses traffic data to estimate how crowded that area is. The user has to do nothing extra and everything is automated for them.
Along with that, it suggests locations to help take care of your wellbeing based on how crowded an area is.
Even after COVID becomes less prominent, this app will allow the users to reduce their stress in waiting in long lines or being in crowded areas by recommending them areas that are less crowded.
We also want to give back to small businesses and with that, we help give incentives such as coupons for businesses that are not crowded at a given moment, that will encourage the user to go out, but in a safe manner as these places are not crowded.

## How we built it
We built the low and high-fidelity prototype using InVision Studio and are working to build the algorithms using py-charm. We are working on implementing a cross platform application using Xamarin and the .NET framework, with a SQL Server backend. Everything will be hosted on Azure and with a REST API we will be able to join the front and back end.

## Challenges we ran into
Researching the idea to see how viable it is and whether it can be developed based on the APIs and information available to us. Along with that, planning an idea that can scale and have long term benefits to the community was difficult and involved us to brainstorm what is needed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy to have come up with an idea that we believe can have benefits at a global scale and even after this pandemic is over, the benefits will still be transferrable, as it will allow the user to have a balanced, healthy, and efficient lifestyle.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Google Cloud and Google's APIs, how to effectively work as a team to develop a scalable project to give back to our society.## What we learned

## What's next for Crowded
We are working to finish this application to launch in the Google Play Store and App Store and will be testing how the market reacts. We will then continue to go through the development lifecycle to further develop the app based off of customer testing and work to scale the app.
